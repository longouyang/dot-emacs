(had to add melpa stable as an archive; HT http://camdez.com/blog/2015/04/03/switching-to-melpa-stable/ )

tried to install org-mode from org archive to get rid of "org-mode fontification erorr" (HT https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gnu.emacs.bug/ol-kKELpOMo) but i still get the problem.

tried then reinstalling ess after installing org - no luck.
